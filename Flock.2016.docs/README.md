# [Hackfest: Fedora Docs Learn and Hack](https://flock2016.sched.org/event/ed4a9f29526b5befe6a86635050cd958)
## Presented at [Flock 2016, Krak√≥w Poland](https://flocktofedora.org) on 4 August 2016

This repo contains the slides and files used for the talk and demo
I presented.  The talk was originally supposed to be presented along
with Pete Travis, however, he, unfortunately, could not make it.

I am very grateful to Pete Travis, Zach Oglesby, and Shaun McCance for
helping me with this presentation and filling in the pieces from the
Docs Fad that I could not attend.

## Talk Description

This two part workshop/hackfest will help you impact Fedora's
Documentation in a positive way. First, we'll learn about the style, tone,
and structure of our docs. Second, we will work on open bugs and improving
docs. It's like an assisted writing clinic on steroids. Hacking can be
focused on open documentation bugs, enhancement requests, or any area that
interests you Presenters: Pete Travis (randomuser) & Brian Exelbierd (bex)
