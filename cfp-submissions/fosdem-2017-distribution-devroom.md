# Title of Devroom: Distributions

# Elaborate description of proposed devroom(Including possible Topics):

Distributions are more than just hosted collections of software from
various upstreams. Each distribution is responsible for problem-solving
in building, testing, and releasing software as well as managing
the lifecycle of each application in the collection.  Additionally,
distributions do very important work in ensuring that  various versions
of upstream software work well together and can  co-exist. Distributions
are also, often responsible, for "de-vendoring" upstream software so
that security fixes can be applied more quickly.

For this distributions devroom, we want to focus on the ways distributions
can work together on the Build/Test/Release cycles through shared ideas
and resources and highlight the ways different projects are innovating
on the lifecycle problem. Hot topics related to the lifecycle problem
are sandboxing, containerization, vendoring, or bundling.

# Why does it fit FOSDEM?:

Distribution developers and maintainers are widely represented at FOSDEM. Many
attendees are involved (in one form or another) in the distribution space, and
would benefit both as a speaker or in the audience of the devroom.  Additionally, as
the OpenSource community grows, many FOSDEM attendees  don't realize how much 
of what they rely on is provided by  distributions. This is not a platform
for debate about the merits of  distribution A vs B as much as a statement
about why picking a  distribution remains a critical success factor for
many applications.

The talks are only part of the story, since many folks are interested in
the distributions space it's not uncommon to start a piece of software or
feature request only to find that the principal authors (or commentors)
are all in the room. Building in a dedicated space for this augments
the fantastic hallway track at FOSDEM.
