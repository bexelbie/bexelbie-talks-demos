# 3 Orchestrators, 1 Dev Environment

## Abstract

As containers continue to change the way we work, developers and deployers are increasingly trying to figure out how to manage them in both dev and prod environments. Problems can arise when developers build in systems that donâ€™t have a high-level of similarity to production. However, the continuing innovation in the container space means that all of the parts are in constant motion. The Atomic Developer Bundle (ADB) is a development environment that makes it easy for developers to use the orchestration tools used in deployment. However, the ADB also provides an advantage to the deployment staff. As changes are made in how orchestration is done, including the wholesale change of orchestration technology, it is easy to shift developers to the new environment without forcing them to learn a new development workflow.

## Audience

Any looking to develop containerized applications of in orchestrated environments or anyone developing production environments who needs to coordinate with developers.

## Benefits to the Ecosystem

People are looking to innovate at both the development and deployment end of the pipeline simultaneously. With so many moving parts a common meeting point is required to keep everyone on the same page. This talk will explore one way to help keep dev and ops working together.
