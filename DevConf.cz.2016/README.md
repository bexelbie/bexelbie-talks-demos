## Presented at [DEVCONF Brno 2016](http://devconf.cz/) on 6 Feb 2016

Speakers:

## Talk Synopsis:
The [Atomic Developer Bundle
(ADB)](https://github.com/projectatomic/adb-atomic-developer-bundle/)
is a development environment for containers from the same people that
are bringing you the Atomic Host. The ADB is growing to help you create
containers for use with Docker, orchestrators like Kubernetes, PaaS
platforms like OpenShift and Mesos. In this presentation, Navid and
Brian will demonstrate how the ADB works with host-based tools and IDEs
on Linux, Windows, and Mac OS X and how you can kickstart development
on Kubernetes, OpenShift, etc on a preconfigured Vagrant box. The talk
will cover the capabilities provided by the Atomic Developer Bundle and
ecosystem of client side tools that can leverage the capabilities and
provide smooth user experience for containerized development. Learn how
to use it, how we built it, and how you can make it better.
