For several years I have worked with the [Fosdem](https://fosdem.org) Distributions DevRoom.

* [FOSDEM Distribution Dev Room @ FOSDEM 2018](fosdem-2018-distribution-devroom.md) - A WIP propsal with Brian Stinson from CentOS for FOSDEM 2018 modelled very heavily on the previous year's submission.
* [FOSDEM Distribution Dev Room @ FOSDEM 2017](2017/fosdem-2017-distribution-devroom.md) - A successful propsal with Brian Stinson from CentOS for FOSDEM 2017 modelled very heavily on the previous year's submission.  Additional useful information is in the [2017](2017) directory.
