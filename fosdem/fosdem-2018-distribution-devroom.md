# Title of Devroom: Distributions

# Elaborate description of proposed devroom(Including possible Topics):

As we more and more workloads are being considered for containerization
in the future and are finally landing in virtualized environments today,
distributions remain a critical success factor and are more important
than ever. Containers, like virtual machines, are not magical and
rely on piles of software being assembled in a way that is repeatable,
reliable, and functional. This is at the very heart of the problem that
distributions have always solved.

Each distribution is responsible for building, testing, and releasing
software as well as managing the lifecycle of each application in the
collection. Additionally, distributions do very important work in ensuring
that various versions of upstream software work well together and can
co-exist. Distributions are also, often responsible, for "de-vendoring"
upstream software so that security fixes can be applied more quickly.

For this distributions devroom, we want to focus on the ways that
distribution technologies can be leveraged to reused allowing for easier
creating of a multi-verse of artifacts from single source trees. We also
want to continue to highlight the huge efforts being made in shared
environments around Build/Test/Release cycles. Hot topics related to
the delivery problem as it impacts updates in terms of both size and
rollback/reliability are expected to be featured.

# Why does it fit FOSDEM?:

From from being just something cared about by "the old guard,"
distribution developers and maintainers are widely represented at
FOSDEM. Many attendees are involved (in one form or another) in the
distribution space, and would benefit both as a speaker or in the
audience of the devroom. Additionally, as the OpenSource community grows,
many FOSDEM attendees don't realize how much of what they rely on is
provided by distributions. This is not a platform for debate about the
merits of distribution A vs B as much as a statement about why picking
a distribution remains a critical success factor for many applications.

The talks are only part of the story, since many folks are interested in
the distributions space it's not uncommon to start a piece of software or
feature request only to find that the principal authors (or commentors)
are all in the room. Building in a dedicated space for this augments
the fantastic hallway track at FOSDEM.
